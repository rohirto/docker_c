    "3. **Setup SSL configuration** : Configure the SSL context to use the appropriate protocols and credentials.\n",
    "4. **Establish the network connection** : Use mbedtls_net_connect() to connect to the server using TCP.\n",
    "5. **Perform the SSL handshake** : The handshake authenticates the server and sets up the session encryption.\n",
    "6. **Send/Receive secured data** : After the handshake, data can be securely sent and received using mbedtls_ssl_write() and mbedtls_ssl_read().\n",
    "7. **Close the connection and cleanup** : Always free allocated resources once you’re done."
