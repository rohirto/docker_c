    "\n",
    "- The little file system (LittleFS) is a fail-safe file system designed for embedded systems, specifically for microcontrollers that use external flash storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Microcontrollers and flash storage present three challenges for embedded storage: **power loss, wear and limited RAM and ROM**. This file system provides a solution to all three of these problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bounded RAM/ROM** - This file system works with a limited amount of memory. It avoids recursion and limits dynamic memory to configurable buffers that can be provided statically.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Power-loss resilient** - It has strong copy-on-write guarantees and keeps storage on disk in a valid state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Wear leveling** - Because the most common form of embedded storage is erodible flash memories, the file system provides a form of dynamic wear leveling for systems that cannot fit a full flash translation layer.\n",
