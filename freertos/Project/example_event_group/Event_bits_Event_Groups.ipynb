    "# Event Bits\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event bits are used to indicate if an event has occurred or not. \n",
    "- Event bits are often referred to as event flags\n",
    "- For example, an application may:\n",
    "    + Define a bit (or flag) that means \"A message has been received and is ready for processing\" when it is set to 1, and \"there are no messages waiting to be processed\" when it is set to 0.\n",
    "    + Define a bit (or flag) that means \"The application has queued a message that is ready to be sent to a network\" when it is set to 1, and \"there are no messages queued ready to be sent to the network\" when it is set to 0.\n",
    "    + Define a bit (or flag) that means \"It is time to send a heartbeat message onto a network\" when it is set to 1, and \"it is not yet time to send another heartbeat message\" when it is set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Event Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "- An event group is a set of event bits. \n",
    "- Individual event bits within an event group are referenced by a bit number. \n",
    "- Expanding the example provided above:\n",
    "    + The event bit that means \"A message has been received and is ready for processing\" might be bit number 0 within an event group.\n",
    "    + The event bit that means \"The application has queued a message that is ready to be sent to a network\" might be bit number 1 within the same event group.\n",
    "    + The event bit that means \"It is time to send a heartbeat message onto a network\" might be bit number 2 within the same event group.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Event Group and Event Bits Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event groups are referenced by variables of type EventGroupHandle_t.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The number of bits (or flags) implemented within an event group depends on whether configUSE_16_BIT_TICKS or configTICK_TYPE_WIDTH_IN_BITS is used to control the type of TickType_t:\n",
    "    + The number of bits (or flags) implemented within an event group is 8 if configUSE_16_BIT_TICKS is set to 1, or 24 if configUSE_16_BIT_TICKS is set to 0.\n",
    "    + The number of bits (or flags) implemented within an event group is 8 if configTICK_TYPE_WIDTH_IN_BITS is set to TICK_TYPE_WIDTH_16_BITS, or 24 if configTICK_TYPE_WIDTH_IN_BITS is set to TICK_TYPE_WIDTH_32_BITS, or 56 if configTICK_TYPE_WIDTH_IN_BITS is set to TICK_TYPE_WIDTH_64_BITS.\n",

    "- These Functions allow a task to, among other things, set one or more event bits within an event group, clear one or more event bits within an event group, and pend (enter the Blocked state so the task does not consume any processing time) to wait for a set of one or more event bits to become set within an event group."
