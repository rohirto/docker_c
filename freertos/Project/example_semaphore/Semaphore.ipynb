    "# Semaphore\n",
    "\n",
    "- A semaphore (sometimes called a semaphore token) is a kernel object that one or more threads of execution can acquire or release for the purposes of synchronization or mutual exclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is useful when two or more tasks accessing the same resource. \n",
    "\n",
    "- A binary semaphore used for synchronization does not need to be ‘given’ back after it has been successfully ‘taken’ (obtained).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A kernel can support many different types of semaphores, including\n",
    "\n",
    "    + binary,\n",
    "    + counting, and\n",
    "    + mutual‐exclusion (mutex) semaphores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Semaphore\n",
    "\n",
    "- Similar to mutex\n",
    "- Can have a value of 1  or  0\n",
    "- Whenever a task asks for a semaphore, the OS checks if the semaphore’s value is 1\n",
    "- If so, the call succeeds and the value is set to 0\n",
    "- Else, the task is blocked\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary semaphores are treated as global resources,\n",
    "\n",
    "    + They are shared among all tasks that need them.\n",
    "    + Making the semaphore a global resource allows any task to release it, even if the task did not initially acquire it\n",
    "\n",
    "## Counting Semaphores\n",
    "\n",
    "- Semaphores with an initial value greater than 1\n",
    "- can give multiple tasks simultaneous access to a shared resource, unlike a mutex\n",
    "- Priority inheritance, therefore, cannot be implemented\n",

    "## Applications of Counting Semaphore\n",
    "\n",
    "- Counting semaphores are typically used for two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Counting events.\n",
    "    2. Resource management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Counting events\n",
    "- In this usage scenario, an event handler will ‘give’ the semaphore each time an event occurs, and a handler task will ‘take’ the semaphore each time it processes an event.\n",
    "- The semaphore’s count value will be incremented each time it is ‘given’ and decremented each time it is ‘taken’.\n",
    "- The count value is therefore the difference between the number of events that have occurred and the number of events that have been processed.\n",
    "- Semaphores created to count events should be created with an initial count value of zero, because no events will have been counted prior to the semaphore being created.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Resource management\n",
    "- In this usage scenario, the count value of the semaphore represents the number of resources that are available.\n",
    "- To obtain control of a resource, a task must first successfully ‘take’ the semaphore. The action of ‘taking’ the semaphore will decrement the semaphore’s count value. When the count value reaches zero, no more resources are available, and further attempts to ‘take’ the semaphore will fail.\n",
    "- When a task finishes with a resource, it must ‘give’ the semaphore. The action of ‘giving’ the semaphore will increment the semaphore’s count value, indicating that a resource is available, and allowing future attempts to ‘take’ the semaphore to be successful.\n",
    "- Semaphores created to manage resources should be created with an initial count value equal to the number of resource that are available.\n",
