    "- task deletion safety, and\n",
    "- one or more protocols for avoiding problems inherent to mutual exclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "A task that obtains a mutex that is used for mutual exclusion must always give the mutex back – otherwise, no other task will ever be able to obtain the same mutex.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in semaphore, any task can take a semaphore and any task can give semaphore.\n",

    "Problems that may arise with mutexes\n",

    "## Binary Semaphore Vs Mutexes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary semaphores and mutexes are very similar, but do have some subtle differences. \n",
    "- Mutexes include a priority inheritance mechanism, binary semaphores do not. \n",
    "- This makes binary semaphores the better choice for implementing synchronization (between tasks or between tasks and an interrupt), and mutexes the better choice for implementing simple mutual exclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mutex vs Semaphore\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the standard producer-consumer problem. \n",
    "Assume, we have a buffer of 4096 byte length. \n",
    "1. A producer thread collects the data and writes it to the buffer. \n",
    "2. A consumer thread processes the collected data from the buffer. \n",
    "3. Objective is, both the threads should not run at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Mutex\n",
    "\n",
    "- A mutex provides mutual exclusion, either producer or consumer can have the key (mutex) and proceed with their work. As long as the buffer is filled by the producer, the consumer needs to wait, and vice versa.\n",
    "- At any point of time, only one thread can work with the entire buffer. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Semaphore\n",
    "\n",
    "A semaphore is a generalized mutex. \n",
    "1. In lieu of a single buffer, we can split the 4 KB buffer into four 1 KB buffers (identical resources). \n",
    "2. A semaphore can be associated with these four buffers. \n",
    "3. The consumer and producer can work on different buffers at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Misconception\n",
    "\n",
    "- There is an ambiguity between binary semaphore and mutex. We might have come across that a mutex is a binary semaphore. But they are not! The purpose of mutex and semaphore are different. Maybe, due to similarity in their implementation a mutex would be referred as a binary semaphore.\n",
    "- Strictly speaking, a **mutex is locking mechanism** used to synchronize access to a resource. Only one task (can be a thread or process based on OS abstraction) can acquire the mutex. It means there is ownership associated with a mutex, and only the owner can release the lock (mutex).\n",
    "- **Semaphore is a signaling mechanism** (“I am done, you can carry on” kind of signal). For example, if you are listening to songs (assume it as one task) on your mobile and at the same time, your friend calls you, an interrupt is triggered upon which an interrupt service routine (ISR) signals the call processing task to wakeup.\n",

    "- If a mutex is created using xSemaphoreCreateMutex() then the required RAM is automatically allocated from the FreeRTOS heap. \n",
    "- If a mutex is created using xSemaphoreCreateMutexStatic() then the RAM is provided by the application writer, which requires an additional parameter, but allows the RAM to be statically allocated at compile time.\n",
